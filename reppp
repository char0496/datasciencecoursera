Calculate average steps for each interval for all days
Plot the Average Number Steps per Day by Interval
Find interval with most average steps
steps_by_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data, mean)
plot(steps_by_interval$interval,steps_by_interval$steps, type="l", xlab="Interval", ylab="Number of Steps",main="Average Number of Steps per Day by Interval")


max_interval <- steps_by_interval[which.max(steps_by_interval$steps),1]
max_interval

The interval with most steps is 835


Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as NA). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data. 1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs) 2. Using Mean for the day compute missing values 3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in. 4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.

Total Number of Missing values are 2304

Calculate Mean
rmeantotal <- mean(StepsTotalUnion$steps)
rmeantotal

Calculate Median
rmediantotal <- median(StepsTotalUnion$steps)
rmediantotal

Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment?

rmediandiff <- rmediantotal - rmedian
rmediandiff

rmeandiff <- rmeantotal - rmean
rmeandiff

Ans. The mean(Mean Var: 0) is the same however the median does have a small variance(Median Var:1.1886792). between the total which includes the missing values to the base
What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
On observation the impact of the missing data has the biggest effect on the 10000 - 150000 step interval and changes frequency from 27.5 to 35 a variance of 7.5

3d.Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
Created a plot to compare and contrast number of steps between the week and weekend. There is a higher peak earlier on weekdays, and more overall activity on weekends.

weekdays <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", 
              "Friday")
new_activity$dow = as.factor(ifelse(is.element(weekdays(as.Date(new_activity$date)),weekdays), "Weekday", "Weekend"))
StepsTotalUnion <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + dow, new_activity, mean)
library(lattice)
xyplot(StepsTotalUnion$steps ~ StepsTotalUnion$interval|StepsTotalUnion$dow, main="Average Steps per Day by Interval",xlab="Interval", ylab="Steps",layout=c(1,2), type="l")
